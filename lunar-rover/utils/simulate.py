    Simulate packet corruption using a three-state Gilbertâ€“Elliott model that corrupts

    The channel is modeled as a Markov chain with three states:
      - "very_good": almost no corruption (mean corruption block size is very low)
      - "regular": moderate corruption (typical burst size)
      - "very_bad": severe corruption (large burst of errors, but rarely entered)

    For each block of the packet, a block corruption length is drawn from a Gaussian
    distribution (with parameters depending on the current state) and then that many
    contiguous bytes (starting at a random index in the block) are overwritten with
    random values.

    After processing each block, the state is updated using the Markov transition matrix,
    allowing transitions into any state. This captures bursty error behavior over the packet.

    Parameters:
        packet (bytes): The original packet as a bytes object.
        drop_on_error (bool): If True, any error in any block results in the packet being dropped (None returned).
